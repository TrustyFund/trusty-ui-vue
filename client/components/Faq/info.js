Why should you trust us?

Trusty is not a person, team or a portfolio management company.
<br/>
Trusty is an open-source wallet for investing in crypto portfolio,
based on the BitShares blockchain (BitShares.org).
Blockchain guarantees that only the account owner controls
their funds and gets fair exchange rates and low trading fees.
You create the account and secure the special backup phrase,
which is literally the only way to access your funds.
<br/>
There is no need to trust anybody but yourself to keep the backup phrase safe.
<br/>

Trusty is an open-source project and
anybody can audit the security of the code on Github:

How does Trusty differ from other crypto exchanges and wallets?
`,
    text: `
Trusty is made for easy investments in the crypto economy for
uneducated and technically inexperienced users. It’s not for day
trading like on traditional exchanges or passive holding like
in case of a regular crypto wallet.

      title: 'Trusty has 4 noteworthy advantages:',
      items: [`
Unlike exchanges, with Trusty you deposit fiat currencies (e.g. USD)
via 3rd party payment service providers, either peer-to-peer exchanges
(e.g. localbitcoins.com) or official legal entities requiring KYC.
After deposit your funds are independently held on the blockchain and
not controlled by the exchange or anybody else.
`,
      `
Deposited funds can be distributed across a
portfolio of assets in few clicks, so there is
no need to buy each asset separately.
`,
      `
You can easily manage the portfolio assets using manual
rebalancing tool, copy trading portfolio managers
or applying index strategy.
`,
      `
You create and hold the backup phrase (i.e. the private key)
from a native blockchain wallet, that cannot be compromised
by hackers externally or shut down by authorities.

    title: 'What is your long-term vision?',
    text: `
We believe that the world is now on the edge of an overwhelming
financial and political inefficiency.
<br/>
Inefficiency driven by centuries of trust and transparency issues.
Blockchain solves this.
<br/>
<br/>
We believe there should be no difference between a wallet or a bank.
There should be no difference between your checking account or investment account.
When you send or receive money, you can easily use any of your investments
or all of them simultaneously as your checking account. (Ex. buy groceries)
<br/>
<br/>
In the era of decentralization, it is not logical to handover
your funds to a third parties management, losing immediate access to your funds.
<br/>
<br/>
We want to have our funds properly managed,
risks diversified across governments, economies, technologies and sectors.
<br/>
<br/>
Before, you had to choose to distribute your funds across different exchanges,
fund managers and asset classes.
<br/>
You shouldn’t change trading platform in order to chase new asset classes.
Fiat currencies, equities, gold, bonds, everything should be easily
manageable and accessible from a single wallet UI.
<br/>
<br/>
The Trusty team is also working on solutions that will allow its users to pay,
hassle-free, anywhere debit or credit cards are accepted.
